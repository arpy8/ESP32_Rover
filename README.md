# [ESP32 Bluetooth Rover](https://www.instagram.com/p/C054P9ZCS_K/)

This repository contains Arduino sketches for a Bluetooth-controlled car using an ESP32 board, a motor driver module, and an ESP32-CAM module for additional functionality. The car can be wirelessly controlled via Bluetooth communication, allowing users to send commands from a Bluetooth-enabled device. The ESP32-CAM module adds the capability to stream video.

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32-Cam board
- Motor driver module (L298N or similar)
- Bluetooth module (HC-05)
- DC motors and wheels
- Power source for the motors (battery pack)
- Chassis and other mechanical components
- Jumper wires
- ESP32-CAM module

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- SoftwareSerial library for Arduino
- ESP32 board support for Arduino IDE
- ESP32 Camera Web Server library (https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32)

Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific hardware setup or add additional features to the rover with the ESP32-CAM. For more details on the ESP32-CAM module, consult its documentation. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me (arpy8).
